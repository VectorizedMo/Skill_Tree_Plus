# Skill_Tree_Plus

# First C++ Project

This is my first psuedo-major project in C++ that I have done, it's quite useful in keeping track of goals. I've designed this program to be scalable, so I can add features whenever I want easily.

Compiles in C++17+

# Utility

Allows you to create a skill tree to keep track of your goals and "skills", which you can save and modify. Useful for organization.
